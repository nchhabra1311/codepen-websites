                            gRPC is a modern open source high performance RPC framework that can run in any environment.
                            It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for 
                            load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication.
                            It is also applicable in last mile of distributed computing to connect devices,
                            mobile applications and browsers to backend services.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            gRPC clients and servers can run and talk to each other in a variety of environments - 
                            from servers inside Google to your own desktop - and can be written in any of gRPCs supported languages.
                            So, for example, you can easily create a gRPC server in Java with clients in Go, Python, or Ruby. 
                            In addition, the latest Google APIs will have gRPC versions of their interfaces, 
                            letting you easily build Google functionality into your applications.

                        <h1>Introduction of Protocol Buffers</h1>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        By default gRPC uses protocol buffers, Google&apos;s mature open source mechanism for serializing structured data 
                        (although it can be used with other data formats such as JSON). 
                        Here&apos;s a quick intro to how it works. If you&apos;re already familiar with protocol buffers,
                         feel free to skip ahead to the next section.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first step when working with protocol buffers is to define the structure for the data you want to
                        serialize in a proto file: this is an ordinary text file with a .proto extension.
                        Protocol buffer data is structured as messages, where each message is a small logical record of information
                        containing a series of name-value pairs called fields. Here&apos;s a simple example:
                    </p>

                    <code>
 message Person {
    string name = 1;
    int32 id = 2;
    bool has_ponycopter = 3;
}
                    </code>

                    <p>
                        Then, once you’ve specified your data structures, you use the protocol buffer compiler protoc
                        to generate data access classes in your preferred language(s) from your proto definition. 
                        These provide simple accessors for each field (like name() and set_name()) as well as methods
                        to serialize/parse the whole structure to/from raw bytes – so, for instance, 
                        if your chosen language is C++, running the compiler on the above example will generate a class called Person.
                        You can then use this class in your application to populate, serialize, and retrieve Person protocol buffer messages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As you’ll see in more detail in our examples, you define gRPC services in ordinary proto files, 
                        with RPC method parameters and return types specified as protocol buffer messages:
                    </p>

                    <code>
// The greeter service definition.
service Greeter {
// Sends a greeting
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}
                            
// The request message containing the user's name.
message HelloRequest {
string name = 1;
}
                            
// The response message containing the greetings
message HelloReply {
    string message = 1;
}
                    </code>

                        Python’s gRPC tools include the protocol buffer compiler protoc
                         and the special plugin for generating server and client code from .proto service definitions.

                    <p>

                        SSL/TLS: gRPC has SSL/TLS integration and promotes the use of SSL/TLS to authenticate the server,
                        and to encrypt all the data exchanged between the client and the server. 
                        Optional mechanisms are available for clients to provide certificates for mutual authentication.
                        Token-based authentication with Google: 
                        gRPC provides a generic mechanism (described below) to attach metadata based credentials to requests and responses. 
                        Additional support for acquiring access tokens (typically OAuth2 tokens) while accessing 
                        Google APIs through gRPC is provided for certain auth flows: you can see how this works in our code examples below. 
                        In general this mechanism must be used as well as SSL/TLS on the channel - Google will not allow connections 
                        without SSL/TLS, and most gRPC language implementations will not let you send credentials on an unencrypted channel.
